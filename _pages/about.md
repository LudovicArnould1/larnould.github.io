I earned my Doctorate in Machine Learning from Sorbonne Université at the end of 2023.

I was working within the departement of statistics (LPSM) under the supervision of Claire Boyer (Sorbonne-Université) and Erwan Scornet (Ecole Polytechnique - Sorbonne Université).
My research was focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of Random Forests, Neural networks and their intersections. 

More recently, I have been very interested in the applications of Deep Learning, especially LLMs applied to NLP.
